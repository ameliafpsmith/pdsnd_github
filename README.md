### Project Title
Explore Data Related to Bike Share Systems for Three Major Cities in the United States
### Description
Describe what your project is about and what it does
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
This project will uncover bike share usage patterns and compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
